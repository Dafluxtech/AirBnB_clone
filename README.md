	AirBnB clone - The console
	Group project
	Python
	OOP
	 By: Guillaume

Concepts:-
These are the concepts to be considered for the project;
	Python packages
	AirBnB clone.


First step: Write a command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects.
This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration…

Each task is linked and will help you to:

	put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
	create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
	create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place…) that inherit from BaseModel
	create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
	create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine


What’s a command interpreter?

Do you remember the Shell? It’s exactly the same but limited to a specific use-case. In our case, we want to be able to manage the objects of our project:

	Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
	Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
	Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
	Update attributes of an object
	Destroy an object

=======
irBnB Clone Project
Part 1 - command interpreter
This project will entail:
Putting in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of future instances
Creating a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
Creating all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place…) that inherit from BaseModel
Create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
Create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine
How to use it:
Start up the console by typing ./console.
Type help to see what commands are available.
Examples:
(hbnb)create BaseModel
22442c9d-2df8-4ad6-9877-fbebe5dc38eb
(hbnb)show BaseModel 22442c9d-2df8-4ad6-9877-fbebe5dc38eb
[BaseModel] (22442c9d-2df8-4ad6-9877-fbebe
